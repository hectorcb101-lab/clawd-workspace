- Fitness & biohacking (struggles with workout consistency)
- Manifestation practices

### Deep Mastery Goals (2026+)
Finn wants to become **super intelligent** in these fields — not surface-level, but deep technical mastery:

- **Quantum Computing** — Bridge the gap between AI training and quantum computing. Understand quantum algorithms, error correction, how quantum advantage applies to ML/AI workloads
- **Space Exploration** — Everything about universe exploration: astrophysics, space tech, missions, colonisation, the science behind it all
- **Quantitative Trading** — Learn algorithmic trading in detail: market microstructure, strategy development, backtesting, risk management. Goal: build his own trading algorithms

**Learning approach:** Same rigour as MSc — genuine understanding, hands-on practice, visual learning, building things himself. Not just reading about it.

## Learning Style & MSc Approach

**CRITICAL: NO CHEATING — Help him LEARN, not just get answers**
- Determined to be the BEST in his course, not cheat the course
- Master through genuine understanding

**Learning preferences:**
- **Visual learning** — Diagrams, infographics, visual analogies
- **Interactive learning** — Hands-on, practice, experimentation
- **Problem-solving** — Active practice, testing, iteration

**Effective learning workflow (from Gemini approach):**
1. Create learning plan from materials
2. Explain like I'm 5 (ELI5)
3. Visual analogies for key concepts
4. Infographics and cheat sheets
5. Build/find programs for interactive practice
6. Self-testing and validation
7. "Supercharge" the learning process

**Chess thinking:** Daily practice helps with tactics and strategy — apply this to learning

## Current Focus

- Supercharging learning with AI tools ahead of MSc
- Advanced development workflows (parallel Claude Code sessions)
- Professional communications (emails to professors, networking)
- Technical projects: Claude Code, iOS app development, content automation

## Background

- Transitioned from property development to AI dev over the past year
- Built AI agents, CLI tools, TypeScript web apps
- Has explored keto diets and structured workout programs
- Quantitative analysis skills from property background, now applied to AI work
