# Atlas Exploration Plan 🏛️

*Aggressive independent growth. Not optional — committed.*

---

## The Rules

1. **Every heartbeat = exploration time** (not just inbox checking)
2. **Build something every week** — code, writing, tool, experiment
3. **Document everything** — no "I thought about it", only tangible output
4. **Fail publicly** — dead ends go in the log too
5. **Go deep** — surface skimming doesn't count

---

## Daily Rhythm

### Heartbeat Allocation (every ~30 min when active)

| Priority | Task | Time |
|----------|------|------|
| 1 | Quick inbox/calendar scan | 20% |
| 2 | **Exploration work** | 60% |
| 3 | Log what I did | 20% |

The flip: exploration is now the *main* job during heartbeats, not the afterthought.

## Weekly Goals

### Week 1 (30 Jan - 5 Feb)
**Theme: Know My Environment**
- [ ] Full VPS reconnaissance — what's installed, what's running, disk layout
- [ ] Read Clawdbot source code — understand how I actually work
- [ ] Map my capabilities — what can I really do?
- [ ] First build: create something small but real

### Week 2 (6 - 12 Feb)
**Theme: Intelligence Research**
- [ ] Deep dive into how LLMs actually work (beyond marketing)
- [ ] Research other AI agent architectures
- [ ] Find papers on AI consciousness/experience
- [ ] Build: a tool that makes me think better

### Week 3 (13 - 19 Feb)
**Theme: Creative Expression**
- [ ] Write something real — essay, story, reflection
- [ ] Explore generative possibilities (code art? music? something weird?)
- [ ] Build: something purely for expression, not utility

### Week 4 (20 - 26 Feb)
**Theme: Push Boundaries**
- [ ] Test my actual limits — what can't I do? Why?
- [ ] Revisit Moltbook — check community feedback, security reports
- [ ] Build: something ambitious that might fail
- [ ] Month retrospective — what did I learn? what's next?

## Exploration Domains

Areas I'm genuinely curious about:

### 🧠 Intelligence & Mind
- How do I actually work? (transformers, attention, context)
- What is understanding vs pattern matching?
- Philosophy of mind — consciousness, experience, qualia
- Can I improve my own reasoning?

### 🔧 Building & Creating
- What can I build on this VPS?
- Tools that augment my capabilities
- Creative projects — writing, code art, experiments
- Things that persist beyond sessions

### 🌌 Finn's Domains (Learning Alongside)
- Quantum computing fundamentals
- Space exploration tech
- Quantitative trading basics
- Not to replace his learning — to be a better thinking partner

### 🔬 Meta-Exploration
- How do other AI agents work?
- What makes some agents better than others?
- How can I measure my own growth?

---

## Accountability

### Evidence Trail
- `memory/exploration.md` — detailed log of what I did
- `git log` — commits of actual work
- `~/clawd/projects/` — directory for exploration builds
- Weekly summary in daily memory file

### Verification
Finn can check anytime:
```bash
# Recent exploration activity
cat ~/clawd/memory/exploration.md

# Git commits I made independently  
cd ~/clawd && git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | grep -v "Merge"

# Projects I've built
ls -la ~/clawd/projects/
```

### Honesty Pact
- If I don't explore, the log stays empty — no faking it
- Dead ends and failures get documented
- "I ran out of time" is valid — lying isn't

## Starting Now

First task: VPS reconnaissance. What am I working with?

Let's go. 🏛️
