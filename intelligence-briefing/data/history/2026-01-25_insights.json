    {
      "asset": "Cryptocurrency",
      "movement": "Major selling (BTC/ETH down 2.9%)",
      "possible_causes": [
        "Geopolitical uncertainty (Iran tensions)",
        "Rising fear (VIX up)",
        "Flight from risk assets while stocks hold"

  "ariadne_opinion": {
    "main_thesis": "Crypto is bleeding, stocks are ignoring it. This is either: (1) Crypto-specific weakness, or (2) The canary in the coal mine.",
    "deep_take": "When crypto leads down while equities hold, it's historically been a mixed signal - sometimes isolated to crypto (regulatory fears, exchange issues), sometimes a leading indicator for broader risk-off within days. The key confirmation signals: Watch **small caps (IWM - represents riskier, smaller companies that often move before large caps)** and **credit spreads (the premium investors demand to hold corporate bonds vs safe Treasuries - widens when fear rises)**. If these weaken, crypto was the early warning.",
    "reasoning": [
      "VIX (the 'fear gauge' - measures expected market volatility) up 2.9% to 16.1 - fear is rising, even if markets don't show it yet",
      "Polymarket (prediction market where people bet real money on events) pricing 17.5% chance of US strikes Iran by...? - these odds reflect what informed bettors think will actually happen"
    ],
    "contrarian_view": "Crypto divergences don't always predict equity moves. Recent patterns (Dec 2025) showed crypto falling 30% while Nasdaq climbed on earnings. Context matters - is this crypto-specific or macro?",
    "what_to_watch": [
      "US strikes Iran by...? (17.5% odds) - if this spikes above 30%, markets will price in higher uncertainty \u2192 expect volatility",
      "BTC support at $85k (price floor where buyers step in) - breaking below this level often triggers more selling as stop-losses hit"
    ],
    "prediction": "**Key price levels:** BTC support at $84-86k (based on whale accumulation data - large holders buying at these prices). Break below $84k suggests deeper selling pressure. Hold above $86k with stocks green = likely isolated crypto weakness.",
    "confidence": "moderate"
  },
  "educational": {
    "concept": "VIX (Volatility Index)",
    "explanation": "The VIX measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, derived from options prices. Often called the 'fear index' because it spikes when investors expect market turbulence.",
    "levels": {
      "<15": "Low fear (complacency)",

      "20-30": "Elevated fear (caution)",

    "current": "16.1",
    "interpretation": "VIX is at 16.1, up 2.9% today - showing rising market uncertainty"
