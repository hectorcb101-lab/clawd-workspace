💡 **ARIADNE'S ANALYSIS**

**My take:** Crypto is bleeding, stocks are ignoring it. This is either: (1) Crypto-specific weakness, or (2) The canary in the coal mine.

When crypto leads down while equities hold, it's historically been a mixed signal - sometimes isolated to crypto (regulatory fears, exchange issues), sometimes a leading indicator for broader risk-off within days. The key confirmation signals: Watch **small caps (IWM - represents riskier, smaller companies that often move before large caps)** and **credit spreads (the premium investors demand to hold corporate bonds vs safe Treasuries - widens when fear rises)**. If these weaken, crypto was the early warning.

**Why this matters:**
  • VIX (the 'fear gauge' - measures expected market volatility) up 2.9% to 16.1 - fear is rising, even if markets don't show it yet
  • Polymarket (prediction market where people bet real money on events) pricing 17.5% chance of US strikes Iran by...? - these odds reflect what informed bettors think will actually happen

**Contrarian angle:** Crypto divergences don't always predict equity moves. Recent patterns (Dec 2025) showed crypto falling 30% while Nasdaq climbed on earnings. Context matters - is this crypto-specific or macro?

**Watch for:** **Key price levels:** BTC support at $84-86k (based on whale accumulation data - large holders buying at these prices). Break below $84k suggests deeper selling pressure. Hold above $86k with stocks green = likely isolated crypto weakness.

**Confidence:** moderate

📈 **WHAT TO WATCH TODAY**
  • US strikes Iran by...? (17.5% odds) - if this spikes above 30%, markets will price in higher uncertainty → expect volatility
  • BTC support at $85k (price floor where buyers step in) - breaking below this level often triggers more selling as stop-losses hit

📚 **LEARN: VIX (Volatility Index)**

The VIX measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, derived from options prices. Often called the 'fear index' because it spikes when investors expect market turbulence.

*Today:* VIX is at 16.1, up 2.9% today - showing rising market uncertainty
