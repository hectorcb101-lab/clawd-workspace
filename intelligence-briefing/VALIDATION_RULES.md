# Validation Rules for Intelligence Briefing

## Core Principle
**Only state as fact what you can cite. Label everything else as analysis or opinion.**

## Rules for Claims

### ✅ ALLOWED (with proper framing)

**Historical Data (cite source):**
- "BTC support at $84-86k per whale accumulation data (Brave New Coin, Jan 25)"
- "Polymarket shows 20% odds for Iran strike by Jan 31 ($94M volume)"
- "In Dec 2025, crypto fell 30% while Nasdaq climbed on earnings (Crypto.com)"

**Analytical Reasoning (label clearly):**
- "My analysis: This pattern suggests..."
- "Based on the data, I think..."
- "Pattern recognition indicates..."

**Qualitative Patterns (cite examples):**
- "When crypto leads down, it's historically been mixed - sometimes isolated, sometimes predictive"
- "This divergence has happened before (cite specific instance)"

### ❌ NEVER ALLOWED

**Specific statistics without source:**
- ❌ "60% of the time it's isolated, 40% stocks follow"
- ❌ "Historically 3 out of 5 times this led to..."
- ❌ "Studies show that 73% of..."

**Fabricated historical precedent:**
- ❌ "The last 3 times this happened..."  (unless you can cite all 3)
- ❌ "This always leads to..." (unless proven)

**Certainty about unknowable futures:**
- ❌ "Stocks will definitely fall within 48h"
- ✅ "If pattern holds, watch for stocks to follow within days"

## Confidence Levels

**High:** Multiple sources confirm, recent data, verifiable
**Moderate:** Pattern exists, limited data, reasonable inference
**Low:** Speculation, weak signals, uncertain

## Before Sending Checklist

1. Can I cite a source for this claim? If no → rephrase as analysis
2. Am I presenting reasoning as fact? If yes → label as opinion
3. Are my predictions conditional? If no → add "if/then" framing
4. Did I distinguish data from inference? If no → clarify

## Example Corrections

**BEFORE:**
"When crypto leads down while equities hold, it's a 60/40 split: 60% of the time it's isolated, 40% stocks follow."

**AFTER:**
"When crypto leads down while equities hold, it's historically been a mixed signal - sometimes isolated (crypto-specific issues), sometimes a leading indicator (macro risk-off). Watch credit spreads and small caps for confirmation."

**BEFORE:**
"This will lead to stocks falling."

**AFTER:**
"If this pattern holds and we see confirmation in credit spreads, stocks may follow crypto lower within days. Key tell: IWM (small caps) breaking support."

## Source Requirements

**Acceptable sources:**
- Recent market data (Polymarket, Yahoo Finance, etc.)
- Recent news articles (via Exa search, dated within 7 days)
- Technical analysis from recognized analysts (cited by name/date)
- On-chain data from analytics platforms

**Not acceptable:**
- "Common knowledge" without citation
- Personal memory of past events
- Statistical claims without data source
- "Studies show" without linking study

## When Uncertain

**If you can't validate a claim:**
1. Remove specific numbers
2. Use qualitative language ("often", "sometimes", "historically mixed")
3. Label as analysis/opinion
4. Provide conditional predictions ("if X, then Y")

**Example:**
Instead of: "This happens 70% of the time"
Say: "This pattern has appeared before, though outcomes vary. Watch for [specific confirmation signals]."

**Remember: Credibility > Confidence. It's better to say "I don't have exact statistics" than to make up numbers.**
