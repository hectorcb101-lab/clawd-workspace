1. Definition and Core ConceptsAlgorithmic Trading (Algo Trading):Algorithmic trading refers to the use of predefined, rule-based computer programs that execute trading orders based on quantitative criteria such as price, volume, time, and other market parameters. The algorithms are explicitly programmed to follow certain logic—for instance, “buy 100 shares of stock X if its price drops by 2% within an hour.”Key characteristics of algorithmic trading:Rule-based: Every instruction is manually coded and deterministic.Speed and efficiency: Algorithms can execute trades in milliseconds, far faster than human capability.Backtesting: Traders can test strategies against historical data to optimize performance.Risk reduction: Algorithms reduce the influence of human emotions such as fear and greed.Common algorithmic trading strategies include:Trend-following strategies: Buying or selling assets based on moving averages or momentum.Arbitrage strategies: Exploiting price differences between markets or assets.Market-making strategies: Placing simultaneous buy and sell orders to capture spreads.Mean reversion strategies: Assuming that prices will revert to their historical average.AI Trading (Artificial Intelligence Trading):AI trading, on the other hand, involves the use of machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and other AI techniques to identify trading opportunities, make predictions, and adapt strategies over time. Unlike traditional algorithms, AI trading systems are capable of learning from data, discovering patterns that may not

###### Abstract
The intricate behavior patterns of financial markets are influenced by fundamental, technical, and psychological factors. During times of high volatility and regime shifts causes many traditional strategies like trend-following or mean-reversion to fail. This paper proposes a hybrid AI-based trading strategy that combines (1) trend-following and directional momentum capture via EMA and MACD, (2) detection of price normalization through mean-reversion using RSI and Bollinger Bands, (3) market psychological interpretation through sentiment analysis using FinBERT, (4) signal generation through machine learning using XGBoost and (5)dynamically adjusting exposure with market regime filtering based on volatility and return environments. The system achieved

Algorithmic trading has revolutionized the financial markets, enabling traders to execute orders at lightning-fast speeds with precision and control. This tutorial will guide you through the journey of developing an algorithmic trading strategy, from the initial hypothesis to the final execution. We’ll cover the essentials of financial data analysis, strategy formulation, backtesting and implementation using Python. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of how to create,

## 🐦 Expert Opinions (X)

@grok (Grok):
Yes, if you're interested in algorithmic trading. The video breaks down a Python-based workflow for data handling, backtesting momentum strategies, and automated order execution using tools like Zipline and Omega. It's a high-level promo for a course, but packed with practical code examples. Takes about 5 minutes.

@grok (Grok):
Algorithmic trading can indeed accelerate learning by backtesting strategies quickly and quantifying results. It builds on stats and game theory nicely. Just ensure you understand the underlying markets to avoid over-reliance on code. Great fallback plan too! What's your go-to algo setup?
