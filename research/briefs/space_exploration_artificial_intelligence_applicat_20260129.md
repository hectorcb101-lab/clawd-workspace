* AI has moved to the center of the space sector, transforming how we design, operate, and govern activity in orbit.
* Though the technology can help unlock new capabilities and innovations, it will also amplify existing challenges, including market concentration and cybersecurity.
* Coordinated yet agile governance will be critical for the success of commercial companies, as well as governments who wish to ensure their citizens benefit from the unprecedented opportunities to improve the quality of life on Earth and beyond.

Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Space to Improve Life on Earth

###### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming a broad range of human activities, from healthcare and agriculture to finance, biotechnology, and industry. As Earth’s technological frontiers begin to plateau, the next inevitable leap for humanity lies in the exploration and utilization of outer space—a domain offering virtually limitless resources, territory, and opportunities. In this grand transition, AI emerges not merely as a tool but as a central enabler, capable of addressing the extreme complexity, uncertainty, and autonomy required for sustainable space operations.
This paper introducesSpace AIas a unified interdisciplinary field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and space science and technology. We consolidate historical developments and contemporary progress, and propose a systematic framework that organises Space AI into four mission contexts: (1)AI on Earth, covering intelligent mission planning, spacecraft design optimisation, simulation, and ground-based data analytics; (2)AI in Orbit, focusing on satellite and station autonomy, space robotics, on-board/near-real-time data processing, communication optimisation, and orbital safety; (3)AI in Deep Space, enabling autonomous navigation, adaptive scientific discovery, resource mapping, and long-duration human–AI collaboration under communication constraints; and (4)AI for Multi-Planetary Life, supporting in-situ resource utilisation, habitat and infrastructure construction, life-support and ecological management, and resilient interplanetary networks.
By providing a clear scope, taxonomy, and mission-aligned viewpoin
