# Research Sub-Agent System

Deep research orchestration for Finn's learning goals.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger**: Finn requests research on a topic
2. **Spawn**: Atlas spawns a background sub-agent with the research task
3. **Execute**: Sub-agent runs deep searches via Exa + X
4. **Deliver**: Results synthesized and sent back to Finn

## Topics of Interest

### Deep Mastery Goals
- **Quantum Computing** - Bridge AI training and quantum computing
- **Space Exploration** - Universe exploration, astrophysics, missions
- **Quantitative Trading** - Algorithmic trading, strategy development

### AI/Tech (ongoing)
- New model releases
- Research papers
- Tools and frameworks

## Usage

From conversation:
- "Research quantum error correction"
- "Deep dive on quant trading backtesting"
- "What's new in space exploration AI?"

Atlas handles the rest.
