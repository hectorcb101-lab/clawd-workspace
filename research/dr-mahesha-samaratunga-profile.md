## 4. Teaching Philosophy: Compassionate Pedagogy

### The Rogerian Person-Centered Approach

Dr Samaratunga is known for pioneering "compassionate pedagogy" in her teaching practice, drawing on **Carl Rogers' person-centered approach** from humanistic psychology.

#### Key Principles (from Rogers' framework):

1. **Unconditional Positive Regard** - Accepting and valuing students without judgment or conditions
2. **Empathy** - Deeply understanding the student's experience and feelings from their perspective
3. **Congruence (Genuineness)** - Being authentic and transparent in interactions

#### Application in Higher Education:

Rogers believed that for individuals to "grow", they need an environment providing:
- **Genuineness** (openness and self-disclosure)
- **Acceptance** (being seen with unconditional positive regard)
- **Empathy** (being listened to and understood)

When applied to education, this creates a supportive environment that:
- Fosters personal growth and self-acceptance
- Reduces psychological barriers to learning
- Enables students to explore their thoughts without fear of judgment
- Supports movement toward self-actualization

Dr Samaratunga's approach emphasises treating students as whole individuals, supporting their wellbeing alongside their academic development.
