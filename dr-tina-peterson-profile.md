---

## Key Themes Across Her Work

Based on the research gathered, several consistent themes emerge:

### 1. **Power and Responsibility in Tech**
Her IEEE paper explicitly addresses how CS ethics education often abstracts power dynamics, potentially leaving graduates unprepared for real-world ethical challenges.

### 2. **Accessibility and Inclusion**
The multi-institutional study on impostor phenomenon demonstrates commitment to understanding and addressing barriers to CS education participation.

### 3. **Interdisciplinary Approach**
Her unique background spanning journalism, mass media/communication, and computer science enables a distinctive perspective on technology's societal impact.

### 4. **Media Literacy**
Drawing from her PhD in Mass Media and Communication, she brings expertise in understanding how information and technology intersect.

### 5. **Critical Thinking**
Her teaching emphasizes worst-case scenarios and critical discussion rather than purely technical training.

### 6. **Stakeholder-Centered Design**
Focus on "communication with diverse human stakeholders" suggests alignment with human-centered design principles.

## Summary Assessment

Dr. Tina L. Peterson represents an increasingly important voice in computing education: a scholar who combines:

- **Non-traditional path** into CS (journalism → mass media → CS ethics)
- **Interdisciplinary expertise** spanning communication, media literacy, and technology
- **Focus on ethics and responsibility** rather than purely technical training
- **Commitment to accessibility** in CS education
- **High-level collaborations** (e.g., with Moshe Vardi)
- **Creative output** (children's fiction author)

Her work addresses a critical gap: ensuring that the next generation of AI practitioners understands not just *how* to build systems, but *why* ethics, power, and responsibility matter.
