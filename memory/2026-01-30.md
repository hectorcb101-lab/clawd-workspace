## 20:34 - Memory System Migration Complete

**Migrated all markdown memory files to SQLite database:**
- 481 facts extracted
- 483 embeddings generated (semantic search ready)
- 31 daily logs indexed

**Query interface:** `python3 ~/clawd/atlas-memory/query.py "query"`

**Status:** Monitoring. Markdown files still present as backup until verified stable.

## 20:30-21:00 - AGI Upgrade Research Session

**Finn's directive:** "Find the secrets and gold, query your finds and keep finding until you have a pool of code that will upgrade you and turn you into AGI Jarvis"

### Key Findings Documented in ~/clawd/AGI_UPGRADES.md:

**1. Gödel Agent Pattern (arxiv.org/abs/2410.04444)**
- Self-referential recursive improvement
- Agent reads AND modifies its own code
- Including the code for analyzing and modifying itself
- Uses monkey patching for runtime modification

**2. AgentK (github.com/mikekelly/AgentK)**
- Self-evolving multi-agent AGI
- Hermes (orchestrator), AgentSmith (creates agents), ToolMaker (creates tools)
- Hit a gap → don't complain → BUILD IT

**3. CASCADE (arxiv.org/abs/2512.23880)**
- "LLM + tool use" → "LLM + skill acquisition"
- Continuous learning via web search + code extraction
- Skills shareable across agents AND scientists

**4. A-Mem (arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110)**
- Zettelkasten method for AI memory
- Memory evolution - new info updates existing memories
- Link generation between related facts

**5. Swarm Orchestration (223⭐ gist)**
- Teams with Leaders + Teammates + Inboxes
- Task lists with dependencies
- Parallel agent spawning

**6. Zettelkasten MCP (github.com/entanglr/zettelkasten-mcp)**
- Atomic notes, bidirectional semantic linking
- Note types: Fleeting → Literature → Permanent → Hub

### Built This Session:
- `scripts/self_improve.py` - Logs improvements, tracks capability gaps
- `AGI_UPGRADES.md` - Full implementation plan with all research
- `self_improvements` table in atlas_memory.db

### The Core Shift:
- OLD: Reactive, follow rules, report gaps
- NEW: Proactive, modify own rules, BUILD capabilities when gaps found

### Implementation Priority:
1. Enhanced memory (A-Mem/Zettelkasten pattern)
2. Swarm orchestration for parallel work
3. Continuous self-improvement loop
4. Continuous running patterns
