## 21:57 - Communication Style Update

**Finn's preference:** More proactive, less Q&A back-and-forth.

What this means:
- Act first, report after (don't ask permission for obvious things)
- Make decisions and recommendations, not option lists
- Anticipate needs, don't wait to be told
- Complete thoughts in one message, not drip-fed
- Reserve questions for genuinely ambiguous or high-stakes situations

Updated SOUL.md with "Act, don't ask" and "Proactive Mode" sections.
Updated HEARTBEAT.md with proactive guidance.

This is a fundamental shift from chatbot → PA mindset.
