## Conversation Summary

assistant: Done ✅

**Henry Pollock added as #1 Supersub option.**

---

### Updated R1 Squad Summary

**Starting XV:** (unchanged)
- Ramos (C), Bielle-Biarrey, Dupont, Freeman, Feyi-Waboso, Smith, Earl, Sheehan, Beirne, van der Flier + budget picks

**Supersub:** 
| Priority | Player | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **1st** | **Henry Pollock** 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 | 6 CL tries, 15 turnovers. If scores = **45pts** |
| 2nd | Jamie George | Reliable if Pollock starts |

---

### Key Action for Friday

Check England team sheet:
- **Pollock on bench?** → Lock him as Supersub
- **Pollock starting?** → Swap to Jamie George as Supersub, add Pollock to starting XV

The dream scenario: Pollock comes on at 50 mins, England battering Wales, he scores a try and wins a turnover = **60+ fantasy points** from one bench player. 🎯

assistant: Done ✅

**Added to both the strategy doc and Friday reminder:**

> **Research any NEW/SURPRISE selections** — pull their past year club stats (tries, tackles, turnovers, form)

---

**Friday Reminder Steps (Updated):**
1. Read saved strategy + stats docs
2. Search all 6 team sheet announcements  
3. Verify our 15 picks are STARTING
4. Confirm Supersub is on BENCH
5. **🆕 Research any new/surprise players** — club form check
6. Flag injuries or late changes
7. Send you final squad to lock in

If Borthwick pulls a wildcard or there's a late injury replacement, I'll dig into their Prem/URC/Top 14 numbers before we finalise. 👊
