# Meta-Learning System for Finn

**Built:** 2026-01-26  
**Purpose:** Learn how Finn learns, optimize all future educational interactions  
**Status:** Active, continuously improving

## System Overview

This is not a study aid. This is a **meta-learning engine** that:
1. **Tracks** what teaching methods work best for Finn
2. **Measures** retention, understanding, and application
3. **Adapts** explanations based on what's proven effective
4. **Experiments** with new approaches and validates results
5. **Optimizes** over time through continuous feedback loops

## Core Principle: Evidence Over Assumptions

Every learning interaction is data. Every explanation is an experiment. We track what works, discard what doesn't, and continuously improve.

## Finn's Learning Profile

**Primary modalities:**
- **Visual:** Diagrams, infographics, spatial representations
- **Interactive:** Hands-on practice, experimentation, building
- **Problem-solving:** Active application, testing, iteration

**Cognitive strengths:**
- Pattern recognition (chess training)
- Tactical/strategic thinking
- System-level understanding
- Engineering mindset

**Goals:**
- Master MSc AI content (starts Jan 28th, 2026)
- Genuine understanding, not surface learning
- Maximize retention and application
- Build transferable mental models

## How It Works

### 1. Capture (During Learning)
Every learning interaction logs:
- What concept was taught
- What method was used (visual, interactive, problem-based)
- Finn's immediate understanding (1-5 scale)
- Questions asked, confusion points

### 2. Measure (Post-Learning)
Track effectiveness through:
- Retention checks (24h, 1 week, 1 month)
- Application success (can Finn use it?)
- Explanation quality (can Finn teach it back?)
- Connection strength (integrated with prior knowledge?)

### 3. Adapt (Future Learning)
Use measured data to:
- Prioritize proven effective methods
- Avoid ineffective approaches
- Personalize explanations to Finn's strengths
- Predict optimal teaching strategies for new topics

### 4. Experiment (Continuous Improvement)
Systematically test:
- Different visual representations (diagrams vs. infographics)
- Explanation depth (ELI5 vs. technical deep dive)
- Practice timing (immediate vs. spaced)
- Analogy effectiveness (chess vs. programming vs. spatial)

## Integration with Existing Systems

**Memory system:** Learning patterns feed into `MEMORY.md` and daily logs  
**Daily workflow:** Quick templates for common learning interactions  
**MSc prep:** Specialized templates for academic content  
**Chess analogy:** Leverage daily chess practice as learning metaphor

## Quick Start

1. **Before teaching anything:** Check `finn-profile.md` for current best practices
2. **During explanation:** Use appropriate template from `templates/`
3. **After learning:** Log session in `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
4. **Periodic review:** Run retention checks, update effectiveness metrics
5. **Weekly:** Review experiment log, update profile with new insights

## Success Metrics

**Immediate (during session):**
- Finn says "that makes sense" with specifics, not just "I get it"
- Asks clarifying questions that show deeper thinking
- Proposes own examples or extensions

**Short-term (24h-1 week):**
- Can explain concept without referring to notes
- Applies concept to solve new problems
- Connects concept to related ideas spontaneously

**Long-term (1 month+):**
- Concept integrated into mental models
- Uses concept in novel contexts
- Can teach concept to others clearly

## Philosophy

This system treats learning like engineering:
- **Measure everything:** Data over intuition
- **Iterate rapidly:** Test, measure, improve
- **Optimize for utility:** What works > what sounds good
- **Build on success:** Double down on effective patterns

Finn doesn't need a tutor. He needs a system that learns as fast as he does.
