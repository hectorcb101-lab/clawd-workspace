# Quick Start Guide: Using Your Meta-Learning System

**For Finn - First thing to read when you wake up**

---

## What Is This?

A system that learns how YOU learn, then optimizes every future learning session. It's not a study tool - it's an **optimization engine** for your brain.

Think of it like training data for an ML model, except the model is how you learn best.

---

## Day 1: How to Use This Right Now

### Before Your MSc Starts (Now - Jan 28th)

**1. When you learn something new today:**

Open `memory/learning-patterns/templates/concept-capture.md` and use it to log:
- What you learned
- How it was taught (visual? hands-on? problem-based?)
- Did it click? (1-5 scale)
- What worked, what didn't

**Time investment:** 5 minutes after each learning session  
**Payoff:** Know exactly what methods work for YOUR brain

---

**2. Create visual diagrams:**

Use `memory/learning-patterns/templates/visual-explanation.md` when creating diagrams:
- One concept per visual
- Start simple, add complexity
- Include chess analogies where relevant
- See `visual-library/neural-network-architecture.md` for examples

**Time investment:** 15 minutes per concept  
**Payoff:** Visual references you can use forever

---

**3. Build hands-on practice:**

Use `memory/learning-patterns/templates/interactive-practice.md` to design exercises:
- Code it yourself immediately after learning
- Start easy, progressively harder
- Learn through doing, not just reading

**Time investment:** 30-60 minutes practice per concept  
**Payoff:** Concepts stick permanently through hands-on building

---

### When MSc Starts (Jan 28th onwards)

**Morning routine (5 minutes):**
- Check yesterday's retention (explain concept from memory)
- Review scheduled retention checks (24h, 1 week, 1 month)
- Plan today's learning approach based on what worked before

**After each lecture/study session (5 minutes):**
- Quick concept capture in `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- Rate understanding (1-5)
- Schedule retention checks

**Weekly review (30 minutes):**
- Review week's learning sessions
- Identify patterns (what worked best?)
- Update your learning profile
- Plan next week's experiments

---

## The Three-File Workflow

### File 1: Quick Capture (During Learning)

**Location:** `memory/learning-patterns/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`  
**Template:** `templates/concept-capture.md`  
**When:** Right after learning something  
**Time:** 5 minutes

Captures:
- What you learned
- How it was taught
- Did it work?
- What to test in retention check

---

### File 2: Retention Check (Spaced Repetition)

**Location:** Same session file, updated  
**Template:** `templates/retention-check.md`  
**When:** 24h, 1 week, 1 month after learning  
**Time:** 5-10 minutes

Tests:
- Can you explain it from memory?
- Can you apply it to new problem?
- What degraded? What stuck?
- Adjust future review schedule

---

### File 3: Your Learning Profile (Evolves Over Time)

**Location:** `finn-profile.md`  
**When:** Update weekly based on evidence  
**Time:** 10 minutes weekly

Tracks:
- What methods work best for you
- Proven effective patterns
- Failed approaches to avoid
- Personalized best practices

---

## Real Example: Learning Neural Networks Today

### Step 1: Learn the concept
- Watch lecture / read material
- Create visual diagram (use visual-explanation template)
- Code simple example (use interactive-practice template)

### Step 2: Capture it (5 min)
- Open `sessions/2026-01-26-neural-networks.md`
- Fill in concept-capture template
- Rate understanding: 4/5 (confident, can apply with guidance)
- Note: "Chess analogy really helped - weights like piece values"

### Step 3: Schedule checks
- Tomorrow: Quick recall test
- Next week: Explain from memory + solve problem
- Next month: Build something using it

### Step 4: Test retention (next day)
- Explain neural networks without looking at notes
- Rate recall: 4/5 (remembered most, forgot some details)
- Note: "Visual diagram helped recall structure"

### Step 5: Update profile (end of week)
- Visual + chess analogy = highly effective
- Immediate coding practice = concepts stick
- Add to best practices in finn-profile.md

---

## The Visual Library

**Location:** `memory/learning-patterns/visual-library/`

This is your visual vocabulary. Every concept you learn gets a diagram.

**Example:** Neural network architecture
- Network diagram (structure)
- Chess analogy (position evaluation = weighted sum)
- Information flow (forward propagation)
- Component breakdown (what each part does)

**How to use:**
1. Create diagram when learning concept
2. Use as reference while coding
3. Show diagram in retention tests - does it trigger recall?
4. Reuse pattern for similar concepts

**See:** `visual-library/neural-network-architecture.md` for full example

---

## Running Experiments

**Location:** `experiments/experiment-log.md`  
**Protocol:** `experiments/EXPERIMENT_PROTOCOL.md`

Test what actually works for your brain.

### Example Experiment: "Do chess analogies help?"

**Week 1:** Learn concept A with chess analogy  
**Week 2:** Learn concept B without chess analogy  
**Week 3-4:** Test retention for both  
**Result:** Chess analogy shows 25% better retention  
**Action:** Use chess analogies for all tactical/pattern concepts

### Priority Experiments to Run First:

1. **Visual types:** Network diagrams vs. flowcharts
2. **Chess analogies:** With vs. without
3. **Practice timing:** Immediate vs. 24h delayed
4. **Explanation order:** ELI5 first vs. technical first

Each experiment takes 2-4 weeks. Run in parallel when possible.

## Integration with Daily Workflow

### Morning (Before chess):
- [ ] Check scheduled retention tests
- [ ] Quick review of yesterday's concepts

### After chess (Brain warmed up):
- [ ] Main learning session
- [ ] Create visuals for new concepts
- [ ] Hands-on practice

### After learning session:
- [ ] 5-min concept capture
- [ ] Schedule retention checks
- [ ] Note what worked/didn't

### Before bed:
- [ ] Quick mental review
- [ ] Note patterns or insights in daily memory file

### Weekly:
- [ ] Review all sessions
- [ ] Update learning profile
- [ ] Plan next week's experiments
- [ ] Adjust methods based on evidence

## Success Indicators

**You're using this system well if:**
- ✅ Retention improves over time (track percentages)
- ✅ Learning new concepts gets faster
- ✅ You can articulate what methods work for you
- ✅ Templates feel helpful, not bureaucratic
- ✅ Profile evolves based on real evidence

**System needs adjustment if:**
- ❌ Too much overhead, not enough learning
- ❌ Templates feel like busy work
- ❌ No clear patterns emerging
- ❌ Not using the data to improve

**Remember: Utility > decoration. If it's not helping, change it.**

## FAQ

**Q: This looks like a lot of work.**  
A: 5 minutes per concept + 5 minutes per retention check. That's ~15 min/day to optimize 2-4 hours of study time. Worth it.

**Q: Do I have to fill in every field?**  
A: No. Capture what's useful. Skip what's not. This is for you, not for show.

**Q: What if a method doesn't work?**  
A: Perfect! That's valuable data. Note it, try something else, compare results.

**Q: How long until I see results?**  
A: Immediate (know if you understood) + 1 week (see retention patterns) + 1 month (optimize methods)

**Q: Can I modify the templates?**  
A: Absolutely. Make them yours. This is a starting point, not gospel.

**Q: What's the minimum viable version?**  
A: Just track: (1) What you learned, (2) How you learned it, (3) Can you recall it 1 week later? Start there.

## Remember

This system exists to make you a more effective learner. It should:
- **Save time** (learn faster, retain longer)
- **Reduce frustration** (know what works)
- **Build confidence** (measure progress)

If it's not doing those things, adjust it until it does.

**You're not here to fill in templates. You're here to master AI.**

The system is just scaffolding. Use what helps. Ignore what doesn't.

**Now go read `finn-profile.md` and see what we already know about how you learn best.**
