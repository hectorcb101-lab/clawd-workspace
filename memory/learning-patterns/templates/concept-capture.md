## Immediate Understanding Assessment

### Finn's understanding (1-5):
1 = Confused, needs re-explanation  
2 = Vague understanding, can't apply  
3 = Understands but uncertain  
4 = Confident understanding, can apply with guidance  
5 = Deep understanding, can extend and teach

**Rating: [ ]**

### Evidence of understanding:
- [ ] Explained concept in own words
- [ ] Generated novel examples
- [ ] Asked deeper "why/how" questions
- [ ] Connected to prior knowledge
- [ ] Identified limitations or edge cases
- [ ] Successfully applied to practice problem
- [ ] Could teach it back clearly

### Evidence of confusion:
- [ ] Needed re-explanation
- [ ] Asked clarifying questions (list below)
- [ ] Struggled with practice problem
- [ ] Verbatim repetition without understanding
- [ ] "I get it" without elaboration
- [ ] Couldn't generate own examples

### Questions Finn asked:
1. 
2. 
3. 

[Good questions = deeper engagement. Track types of questions.]

### Confusion points:
[What was unclear? What needed extra explanation?]
