# Visual Explanation Template

**Use when creating visual learning materials for Finn**

---

## Concept to Visualize

**Concept name:**  
**Complexity level:** [ ] Simple [ ] Moderate [ ] Complex  
**Abstraction level:** [ ] Concrete [ ] Mixed [ ] Abstract

---

## Visual Strategy Selection

### What type of relationship needs visualization?

- [ ] **Hierarchical** → Tree diagram, taxonomy, inheritance
- [ ] **Network** → Graph, connections, relationships
- [ ] **Sequential** → Flowchart, timeline, pipeline
- [ ] **Comparison** → Venn diagram, matrix, table
- [ ] **Spatial** → Layout, architecture, structure
- [ ] **Quantitative** → Graph, chart, distribution
- [ ] **Process** → Step-by-step, transformation, algorithm
- [ ] **Conceptual** → Metaphor, analogy, mental model

### Optimal visual type for this concept:
[Choose based on concept structure and Finn's pattern recognition strengths]

---

## Diagram Design (Keep it Clean)

### Core principle: **One concept per diagram**
[Avoid cognitive overload - if too complex, split into multiple visuals]

### Central element:
[What's the main focus? This should be immediately obvious]

### Key components (limit 3-7):
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

### Relationships to show:
- 
- 
- 

### Color coding (if needed):
[Use consistently across all diagrams]
- Color 1 = 
- Color 2 = 
- Color 3 = 

---

## Visual Vocabulary (Consistent Shapes)

**Use same shapes for same concepts across all diagrams:**

- **Circles** = entities, objects, nodes
- **Rectangles** = processes, operations, functions
- **Diamonds** = decisions, conditions, gates
- **Arrows** = flow, causation, transformation
- **Dashed lines** = optional, weak connection, abstraction

[Consistency helps Finn recognize patterns across topics]

---

## Diagram Sketch

```
[Draw ASCII sketch or describe layout]

Example:
    Input
      ↓
  [Process]
      ↓
   Decision?
   /      \
 Yes      No
  |        |
Output  Retry
```

---

## Annotations

### Labels to include:
- [ ] Component names
- [ ] Relationship descriptions
- [ ] Key formulas/equations
- [ ] Example values
- [ ] Constraints/limitations

### Avoid:
- [ ] Long text blocks (use companion verbal explanation instead)
- [ ] Tiny fonts
- [ ] Cluttered details
- [ ] Redundant information

---

## Progressive Complexity

### Version 1: Simple overview
[Bare minimum to understand concept]

### Version 2: Standard detail
[Most common use case with key details]

### Version 3: Complete picture
[Full complexity with edge cases]

[Start with V1, add complexity only after Finn grasps basics]

---

## Chess Analogy (If Applicable)

### Does this concept map to chess thinking?

- [ ] **Tactical motif** (fork, pin, skewer, etc.)
- [ ] **Positional concept** (space, pawn structure, piece coordination)
- [ ] **Strategic principle** (planning, evaluation, trade-offs)
- [ ] **Pattern recognition** (known positions, combinations)
- [ ] **Not applicable**

### Chess analogy:
[If yes, describe the mapping]

---

## Accompanying Explanation

### ELI5 version:
[Simple explanation that goes with the diagram]

### Technical version:
[Precise explanation for deeper understanding]

---

## Companion Infographic (Optional)

### Could this be summarized as cheat sheet?
- [ ] Yes - create infographic with key points
- [ ] No - diagram is sufficient

### Infographic content (if yes):
- Key formula/algorithm
- When to use it
- Common pitfalls
- Quick reference example

---

## Interactive Element (If Applicable)

### Can Finn interact with this visually?

- [ ] **Code implementation** - build it to see it
- [ ] **Parameter tweaking** - visualize effect of changes
- [ ] **Animation** - show process over time
- [ ] **Simulation** - play with inputs/outputs
- [ ] **Not applicable** - static is sufficient

### Interactive idea:


---

## Effectiveness Prediction

### Will this visual help Finn?

**Predicted effectiveness (1-5):** [ ]

**Why this visual should work:**
- 
- 

**Potential issues:**
- 
- 

---

## Visual Reference

### Save diagram as:
`memory/learning-patterns/visual-library/[concept-name]-diagram.md`

### Reusable for similar concepts:
- [ ] Yes - add to pattern library
- [ ] Partially - adapt for variations
- [ ] No - concept-specific

---

## Dual Coding Checklist

Before finalizing, ensure:
- [ ] Visual is clear and focused (not cluttered)
- [ ] Verbal explanation complements (not repeats) visual
- [ ] Key relationships are obvious at a glance
- [ ] Could be understood with minimal text
- [ ] Consistent with other visuals in library
- [ ] Finn can use this as future reference

---

## Testing Plan

### How to validate this visual works:

**Immediate test:**
- Show diagram → Ask Finn to explain concept
- Success = explains accurately using visual

**Retention test (1 week):**
- Show diagram → Does it trigger recall?
- Success = diagram serves as effective memory cue

**Application test:**
- New problem → Can Finn sketch similar diagram?
- Success = visual pattern transferred

---

**Remember: Finn is visual learner. A good diagram is worth 1000 words of explanation.**

**Prioritize clarity over completeness. Simple and useful > complex and impressive.**
