## Problem Design

### The Challenge:

[Clear, specific problem statement]

**Problem context:** [Why does this problem matter? Real-world application?]

**Success criteria:**  
[What does a successful solution look like?]

---

## Difficulty Calibration

### Finn's current level with this concept:
- [ ] Never seen it - **Novice**
- [ ] Just learned - **Beginner** 
- [ ] Used once or twice - **Intermediate**
- [ ] Comfortable with it - **Advanced**

### Problem difficulty:
- [ ] **Tutorial** - Step-by-step guidance throughout
- [ ] **Guided** - Framework provided, fill in key parts
- [ ] **Structured** - Problem + hints available
- [ ] **Open** - Problem only, no scaffolding
- [ ] **Challenge** - Deliberately difficult, may fail

### Optimal difficulty for learning:
[Aim for "desirable difficulty" - challenging but achievable]

**Target:** [ ]

---

## Scaffolding & Hints

### What's provided:
- [ ] Starter code template
- [ ] Function signatures
- [ ] Test cases
- [ ] Example input/output
- [ ] Reference documentation
- [ ] Similar worked example
- [ ] Nothing - blank slate

### Hint system (use sparingly):

**Hint 1 (conceptual):**  
[What direction to think about, no specifics]

**Hint 2 (strategic):**  
[What approach might work]

**Hint 3 (tactical):**  
[Specific step or method to use]

**Full solution available?**
- [ ] Yes, after attempt
- [ ] Yes, after time limit
- [ ] No, work it out together

[Balance: Too many hints = no learning. Too few = frustration.]

---

## Learning Through Failure

### Productive failures to experience:

**Failure scenario 1:**  
[What wrong approach might Finn try?]

**Learning opportunity:**  
[What does this failure teach?]

---

**Failure scenario 2:**  
[What wrong approach might Finn try?]

**Learning opportunity:**  
[What does this failure teach?]

---

[Let Finn struggle productively. Don't rescue too quickly.]

---

## Interactive Elements

### Can this practice be visualized?
- [ ] Show algorithm in action (step-by-step visualization)
- [ ] Plot results (graphs, charts)
- [ ] Animate process (watch it work)
- [ ] Compare outputs (A vs B)

### Tools to use:
- [ ] Python notebooks (Jupyter)

- [ ] Visualization library
- [ ] Command-line tool
- [ ] Web interface

## Experimentation Encouraged

### Parameters to play with:
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Questions to explore:
- "What happens if you change X?"
- "Can you make it faster/better?"
- "What breaks it?"
- "What's the optimal value for Y?"

### Expected discoveries:
[What insights should Finn gain from experimenting?]

---

## Testing & Validation

### How Finn knows it's working:

**Correctness tests:**
- [ ] Unit tests provided
- [ ] Example outputs to match
- [ ] Expected behavior described
- [ ] Self-evident (obvious when right)

**Understanding tests:**
- [ ] Explain what your code does
- [ ] Predict output before running
- [ ] Modify for new requirement
- [ ] Debug intentional error

---

## Reflection Questions (Post-Practice)

### Understanding check:
1. What did you just build/solve?
2. How does this demonstrate the concept?
3. What was the hardest part? Why?
4. What would you do differently next time?

### Deeper thinking:
1. Where could you use this in real work?
2. What are the limitations of this approach?
3. How does this connect to other concepts you know?
4. What questions do you still have?

---

## Success Indicators

### Finn successfully learned if he:
- [ ] Completed the task (even with hints)
- [ ] Can explain what he built
- [ ] Made meaningful mistakes and corrected them
- [ ] Experimented beyond requirements
- [ ] Asked good questions during process
- [ ] Could modify solution for new requirement

### Signs practice was too easy:
- [ ] Completed without thinking
- [ ] No mistakes or struggles
- [ ] Bored or disengaged
- [ ] "That was obvious"

[If too easy, skip to Version 3 or create harder variation]

### Signs practice was too hard:
- [ ] Gave up quickly
- [ ] Frustrated and stuck
- [ ] Needed excessive hints
- [ ] Couldn't get unstuck

[If too hard, add more scaffolding or break into smaller steps]

---

## Follow-Up Practice

### Spaced practice (24h later):
[Similar problem, different context - test retention]

### Extended challenge (1 week later):
[More complex version - test deeper understanding]

### Transfer task (1 month later):
[Apply to novel situation - test mastery]

---

## Connection to Real Work

### Where Finn might use this:


### Future extension ideas:
[How could this practice become a real tool/project?]

---

## Optimization Notes

### What worked well in this practice:


### What could be improved:


### Try next time:


### Reusable for similar concepts?
- [ ] Yes - save as template pattern
- [ ] Partially - adapt as needed
- [ ] No - concept-specific

## Metadata

**Practice complexity:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High  
**Estimated duration:** ____ minutes  
**Prerequisites:** [What must Finn know before attempting?]  
**Tools/environment needed:**

**Related practices:**
