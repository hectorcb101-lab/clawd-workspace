# Retention Check Template

**Use for spaced repetition testing: 24h, 1 week, 1 month after learning**

---

## Check Info

**Original learning date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Check date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Time since learning:** [24h / 1 week / 1 month / other]  
**Topic:** [Concept being tested]

---

## Recall Test (Before Any Review)

### Explain the concept from memory:

[Finn's explanation - NO NOTES, NO HINTS]

---

### Core components remembered:
- [ ] Main idea/definition
- [ ] Key mechanism/how it works
- [ ] When/why to use it
- [ ] Limitations/edge cases
- [ ] Connection to related concepts

---

## Recall Quality Assessment

### Accuracy (1-5):
1 = Mostly incorrect  
2 = Partial recall, significant gaps  
3 = Core idea correct, details fuzzy  
4 = Accurate with minor gaps  
5 = Complete and accurate

**Rating: [ ]**

### Confidence (1-5):
1 = Very uncertain  
2 = Uncertain, lots of hesitation  
3 = Somewhat confident  
4 = Confident, minor uncertainty  
5 = Very confident

**Rating: [ ]**

### Fluency (1-5):
1 = Struggled to recall anything  
2 = Slow, lots of effort to remember  
3 = Moderate effort needed  
4 = Came back fairly quickly  
5 = Immediate recall

**Rating: [ ]**

## Application Test

### Problem to solve:
[Give Finn a NEW problem that requires using this concept]

---

### Finn's solution:

[His approach/answer]

---

### Application success:
- [ ] Recognized when to use the concept
- [ ] Applied correctly without hints
- [ ] Applied correctly with hints
- [ ] Remembered concept but couldn't apply
- [ ] Didn't remember concept at all

---

## Degradation Analysis

### What was forgotten?
- [ ] Entire concept
- [ ] Key details
- [ ] Mechanism/how it works
- [ ] When to use it
- [ ] Related connections
- [ ] Nothing - full retention

### What was remembered well?
- 
- 

### What needed reinforcement?
- 
- 

---

## Learning Method Correlation

**Original teaching method:**
- Visual type: __________
- Practice type: __________
- Analogies used: __________

**Hypothesis:** Did this method produce good retention?
- [ ] Yes - high retention, use again
- [ ] Partial - some retention, could improve
- [ ] No - poor retention, try different method

---

## Re-Learning (If Needed)

### Was re-teaching required?
- [ ] No - retention was sufficient
- [ ] Partial - brief refresher given
- [ ] Yes - significant re-teaching needed

### If re-taught, method used:
[What approach was used for refresher?]

### Re-learning speed vs. original:
- [ ] Faster - relearning easier
- [ ] Similar - took same effort
- [ ] Slower - more difficult than first time

---

## Updated Understanding

### New insights gained:
[Did reviewing/applying reveal anything new?]

---

### Connections strengthened:
[Did this concept integrate better with other knowledge?]

---

## Next Steps

### Schedule next check:
- [ ] 1 week from now
- [ ] 1 month from now
- [ ] 3 months from now
- [ ] Retired (mastered, no more checks needed)

### Adjust review frequency:
- [ ] More frequent (poor retention)
- [ ] Keep current schedule
- [ ] Less frequent (strong retention)

### Notes for next review:
[What to focus on? What to test differently?]

## Pattern Recognition

### Retention trend for this concept:
24h: [ ] 1w: [ ] 1m: [ ]  
[Track improvement/degradation over time]

### Similar concepts with better/worse retention:


### Hypothesis for difference:
