## Conversation Summary

assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +14s 2026-01-26 21:25 UTC] What’s ELI5 breakdowns?
[message_id: 1347]
assistant: **ELI5 = "Explain Like I'm 5"**

It's a way of breaking down complex concepts into dead simple terms — no jargon, just intuition and analogies.

For example:

**Matrices (normal):** "A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns used for linear transformations..."

**Matrices (ELI5):** "Imagine a spreadsheet. Each cell has a number. When you multiply this spreadsheet by a list of numbers, it transforms that list — like a machine that takes inputs and spits out different outputs. Neural networks are basically thousands of these spreadsheets stacked together."

It matches your visual/interactive learning style from what you told me. Build intuition first, then layer on the formal notation.

Want me to do ELI5 + visuals for the Tier 1 chapters?
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +3m 2026-01-26 21:29 UTC] Well I have already looked into set theory logic and functions
[message_id: 1349]
assistant: Nice — that's Chapter 4 and most of Chapter 3 ticked off already. 

**Your focus then:**

**Linear Algebra (the big one for ML):**
• Ch 8: Vectors
• Ch 9: Matrices  
• Ch 7: Determinants

**Calculus:**
• Ch 11: Derivatives — especially §11.13 (partial derivatives) and §11.14 (chain rule)
• Ch 12: Integration

That's really the core of it. Vectors + matrices are how data exists in ML. Derivatives are how models learn.

Where do you want to start — linear algebra or calculus? I can break down whichever feels less familiar.
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +2m 2026-01-26 21:31 UTC] Will these topics come under stats?
[message_id: 1351]
assistant: Different things actually:

**This book (what we're covering):**
• Linear algebra + calculus = the *machinery*
• How computations work, how models transform data, how gradients flow

**Statistics (separate):**
• Probability distributions, Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing
• How we *reason under uncertainty* and interpret results

Your MSc will likely have:
1. **Maths foundations module** — vectors, matrices, calculus (this book)
2. **Stats/probability module** — distributions, inference, statistical learning
3. **ML modules** — use both together

This textbook doesn't cover stats — you'll need separate material for that. But the calculus here (especially integration) builds the foundation for understanding probability density functions, expected values, etc.

Has QMUL sent you a module list yet? Would help me map what you need to prep.
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
