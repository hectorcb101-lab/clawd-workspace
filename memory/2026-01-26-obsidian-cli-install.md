However, there's an important note: This server is running Linux, but Obsidian typically runs on your local machine (Mac/Windows). The `obsidian-cli` tool needs access to your Obsidian vault files, which are likely on your local machine.

**To use Obsidian with Clawdbot, you have a few options:**
1. Sync your Obsidian vault to this server (via git, rsync, or cloud sync)
2. Run Clawdbot locally on your machine where Obsidian is installed
3. Use a shared location (like iCloud/Dropbox) that both can access

Where is your Obsidian vault currently located?
