## Conversation Summary

assistant: Sent v6. Major upgrades:

**Design:**
- Editorial style (Playfair Display serif headlines, Source Sans body)
- Clean data table for markets (like Bloomberg terminal)
- Subtle gold accent lines instead of boxes
- Monospace font for tickers and numbers
- Quote styling for tweets
- Less visual clutter, more whitespace

**Glossary Key added:**
- VIX explained (volatility/fear gauge)
- SPY explained (S&P 500 ETF)  
- Beta explained (price swing sensitivity)

Check inbox. This should feel more like FT or The Economist, less like a dashboard.

[message_id: 2092]
assistant: My bad! Reverting to v5 design, just tweaking the boxes to look more polished. One sec:
assistant: Sent v7. Kept your original design, just refined the boxes:

**Box improvements:**
- Top gradient bar instead of left border (cleaner)
- Subtle shadow + border combo (more depth)
- Better spacing and typography
- Insight boxes have labeled headers now

**Added glossary** in the quant section explaining VIX, SPY, Beta

Same overall layout as before, just polished boxes. Check inbox.

[message_id: 2094]
assistant: Good to know 👌 That navy + gold is your brand now. Locked in for all Atlas communications.

How's v7 looking? Any other tweaks or is this the final template?
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +46s 2026-01-30 13:12 UTC] 👌🏻
[message_id: 2097]
assistant: Perfect. v7 is now the master template for daily briefings 🏛️

I'll save this and use it for tomorrow's 9 AM drop. Ready for that ML quiz whenever you are, or anything else you need to sort first?
