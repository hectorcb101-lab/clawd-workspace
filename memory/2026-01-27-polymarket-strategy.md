## Conversation Summary

assistant: Done. New strategy:

**What we're trading now:**
• Fed decisions (monthly — next is March)
• Crypto price targets (weekly/monthly)
• Sports — Super Bowl is Feb 9
• Short-term political events (weeks not years)

**Rules:**
• Nothing resolving more than 4 weeks out
• Fast feedback = faster learning
• The Taiwan/ceasefire positions stay on the books but we're not adding to long-dated stuff

The Fed January position resolves tomorrow — that'll be our first actual result. Then I'll hunt for Feb opportunities in the weekly roundup.
