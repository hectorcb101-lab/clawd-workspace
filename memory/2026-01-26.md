## Six Nations Fantasy Rugby Research - COMPLETE

Finn asked me to build a winning Six Nations Fantasy Rugby team. £85 pot, 17 competitors.

**Full strategy document:** `/home/ubuntu/clawd/projects/six-nations-fantasy-2026/STRATEGY.md`

### Key Findings

**2025 Historical Data (Proven):**
- Thomas Ramos: 71 points (tournament top scorer)
- Louis Bielle-Biarrey: 8 tries (tournament RECORD, scored every game)
- Tommy Freeman: Also scored in every game
- France: 30 tries total (most ever in Six Nations)

**2026 Betting Odds:**
- France 8/11 (heavy favourites)
- England 11/4 (11-game winning streak)
- Ireland 5/1
- Scotland 14/1
- Wales 100/1 (AVOID)
- Italy 125/1

**Critical Squad Changes:**
- France DROPPED: Penaud, Alldritt, Fickou (SHOCK)
- Italy: Capuozzo OUT injured
- England: In blistering form
- Wales: New coach, wooden spoon 2 years

### Round 1 Optimal Squad
- **Captain:** Thomas Ramos (non-10 kicker = double kicks)
- **Core:** Bielle-Biarrey, Dupont (France) + Earl, Smith, Freeman, Feyi-Waboso (England) + Sheehan, Beirne, van der Flier (Ireland)
- **Budget:** Simone Ferrari (8★), Menoncello (10★)
- **Supersub:** Jamie George (English hooker, reliable sub)

### Winning Strategy
1. Captain Ramos every France game
2. Stack teams with easy fixtures (4 max)
3. Target try-scoring forwards (15pts vs 10pts)
4. Exploit lineout steal specialists (7pts each)
5. Use unlimited transfers aggressively

### Next Steps
- Set reminder for Friday 30th Jan (team sheets released)
- Help Finn lock in team before R1 deadline

## Deep Trading Research (22:50 UTC)

Finn challenged me to teach myself trading mastery — similar to my engineering deep dive. Created comprehensive `TRADING_MASTERY.md` framework covering:

**Sources researched:**
- Kelly Criterion (QuantStart, Wikipedia, TradingView, Investopedia)
- Prediction market strategies (Polymarket/Kalshi playbooks, arbitrage guides)
- Jim Simons / Renaissance Technologies (multiple breakdowns)
- Ray Dalio's principle-based investing
- Trading psychology (tilt avoidance, emotional discipline)
- Professional vs amateur trader distinctions

**Key synthesised insights:**

1. **Edge is everything** — Trading is not prediction, it's probability exploitation
2. **Fractional Kelly** — Never use full Kelly; 25-50% is professional standard
3. **Process > Outcome** — Rate your execution, not your P&L
4. **Prediction markets have specific edges:**
   - Longshot bias exploitation (entertainment/politics markets inefficient)
   - Last-second mispricing near resolution
   - Arbitrage (same-market, cross-platform, combinatorial)
   - Information processing speed

5. **Renaissance principles:**
   - Science, not finance
   - Remove all emotion (system is king)
   - Small edge × high volume = returns
   - Constant evolution (edges decay)

6. **The 10 Commandments I derived:**
   - Know your edge (quantify it or you don't have one)
   - Size correctly (fractional Kelly)
   - Protect capital (survival first)
   - Control emotions (process-oriented)
   - Systematise everything
   - Journal everything
   - Expect losses (tuition, not failure)
   - Stay humble
   - Keep learning
   - Be patient

**This is a test from Finn** — He wants to see my research and self-teaching abilities. Delivered a comprehensive 13KB framework document.

## Trading System Built (23:03-23:08 UTC)

**Problem identified:** Need historical data, live intuition, emotional seasoning
**Solution implemented:** Built paper trading infrastructure

**Files created:**
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/TRADING_MASTERY.md` - 13KB framework document
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/trading/scanner.py` - Arbitrage and opportunity scanner
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/trading/edge_finder.py` - Behavioral bias detector
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/trading/paper_trader.py` - Paper trading system with Kelly sizing
- `/home/ubuntu/clawd/trading/monitor.py` - Position monitoring

**First paper trades placed:**
1. **Russia-Ukraine ceasefire by March 31, 2026 - NO** ($15 @ 0.855)
   - Reasoning: Conflict ongoing, 2 months insufficient, longshot bias
   - My probability: 92% NO (ceasefire only 8% likely)

2. **China invades Taiwan by end of 2026 - NO** ($17 @ 0.865)
   - Reasoning: No military buildup, US deterrence, classic geopolitical overpricing
   - My probability: 93% NO

3. **Fed no change January 2026 - YES** ($17 @ 0.989)
   - Reasoning: Fed signalled no cut, economy stable
   - My probability: 99.5% (small edge, high confidence)

**Portfolio status:** $51 cash, $49 exposure, 3 open positions

**Cron job added:** Trading Monitor (every 8 hours)

**Key insight:** Simple arbitrage opportunities are eaten by bots. Edge exists in:
1. Behavioral biases (longshot overpricing)
2. Domain expertise (faster news interpretation)
3. Multi-market correlations humans miss

**Next steps:**
- Wait for Fed decision Jan 27-28 (first trade resolution)
- Track position movements
- Build intuition through paper trading
- Consider real trades if edge proves consistent
