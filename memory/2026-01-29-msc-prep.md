## Conversation Summary

assistant: Read through everything. Your plan is solid — covers 90% of the lecture content. Here's what's missing:

---

**🚨 Gaps to fill:**

1. **Ethics - Vulnerable populations**
   The lecture specifically covers WHO is most at risk: children, elderly, socially isolated, people with mental health issues. Add this to your discussion prep — it's an exam/essay topic.

2. **Ethics - Chatbot risk categories**
   Three specific risks from lecture: (1) Profit-seeking motives, (2) Hallucinations/unpredictable content, (3) Users interact alone = no intervention possible. Not in your checklist.

3. **Statistics - Visual bias**
   The lecture opens with a profit chart showing how identical data can be spun as "holding steady" or "smoking hot" depending on Y-axis scaling. Good exam question territory.

4. **Library books are URGENT**
   "Bad Science" and "Thinking Fast and Slow" have MANDATORY chapters coming. Get them this week, not "start reading" — specific chapters will be assigned.

**✅ You're covered on:**
- All Python basics
- ML taxonomy + lab
- ELIZA, automation bias, parasocial
- Sally Clark & Lucia de Berk cases
- Week 2 Ethics readings
- Regression prep videos

---

**Quick fix:** Add to your Ethics checklist:
- [ ] List 4 vulnerable groups for chatbot harm
- [ ] Name 3 chatbot risk categories
- [ ] Explain visual bias in data presentation

assistant: NO_REPLY
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: ⚠️ **Context at 80%** (161k/200k) — already had 1 compaction this session.

If you've got more heavy tasks, might be worth starting fresh (`/new`) to avoid mid-task compaction. Otherwise we're fine for light stuff.
