Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +9m 2026-01-27 15:01 UTC] What do the extra plugins do, are they worth it for our use case
[message_id: 1661]
assistant: Here's my honest take for your setup:

**Must-Have (Install Now):**

| Plugin | Why You Need It |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Templater** | Way more powerful than core Templates. Variables, dates, prompts. Makes your lecture/seminar templates actually useful. |
| **Calendar** | Visual daily notes. Click a date → see that day's notes. Essential for tracking lectures over the term. |
| **Advanced Tables** | You'll be making lots of tables. This makes editing them not painful. |

**Worth It (Install When Needed):**

| Plugin | When |
|--------|------|
| **Dataview** | Once you have 50+ notes. Query your vault like a database ("show all notes tagged #statistics"). Overkill now, powerful later. |
| **Excalidraw** | When you need diagrams that Mermaid can't do. Freehand sketches, architecture diagrams, visual thinking. |
| **Citations / Zotero** | When you start writing essays/dissertation. Manages references, auto-formats citations. |
| **LaTeX Suite** | If you're doing lots of maths. Snippets like `@a` → `\alpha`. Speeds up equation writing 10x. |

**Skip For Now:**

| Plugin | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Kanban** | You have other task systems. Adds clutter. |
| **PDF++** | Core PDF embed is fine. Only if you need heavy annotation. |

**My recommendation:** Install **Templater**, **Calendar**, and **Advanced Tables** now. You'll use them immediately. Add others as the need arises.

Want me to add setup notes for any of these?
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +24s 2026-01-27 15:02 UTC] Stop with the tables in texts I can’t read it
[message_id: 1663]
assistant: Got it, sorry. Telegram doesn't render tables.

**Install now:**
- **Templater** — Better templates with variables and dates
- **Calendar** — Click a date, see that day's notes
- **Advanced Tables** — Makes editing tables in Obsidian easier

**Install later when you need them:**
- **Dataview** — Query your notes like a database (once you have 50+ notes)
- **Excalidraw** — Freehand diagrams
- **LaTeX Suite** — Faster maths typing
- **Citations** — When you write essays/dissertation

**Skip:**
- Kanban, PDF++ — not needed for your setup

Start with the first three. Add others as you go.

assistant: Nice. You're set up.

Quick wins now that you have them:

**Templater:** Go to Settings → Templater → Set template folder to `Templates`. Then `Cmd+P` → "Templater: Create new note from template"

**Calendar:** Should appear in right sidebar. If not, `Cmd+P` → "Calendar: Open"

**Advanced Tables:** Just start editing any table — Tab to move between cells, auto-formats as you type.

MSc starts tomorrow. Your system is ready. 🏛️
