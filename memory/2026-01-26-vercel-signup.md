## Conversation Summary

assistant: Let me try the hobby/personal option for a simpler flow:
assistant: I'm running into issues with Vercel's authentication flow in the headless browser - it's not proceeding past the email entry screen. OAuth flows are tricky in headless mode because they often use popups and client-side redirects that don't work well.

**Quickest solution:** You create the account manually (takes 2 minutes):
1. Go to https://vercel.com/signup
2. Choose "personal projects"  
3. Enter name "Hector"
4. Click "Continue with Google" → select hectorcb101@gmail.com
5. Done!

Once you've created it, I can handle deploying projects through the Vercel CLI. Should I prepare a sample project to deploy while you set up the account?
