### 🏛️ DeepMind Internship Research
Created Obsidian note: `Google DeepMind Internship - Personal Statement Notes.md`

**Key quote found (Dario Amodei at Davos 2026):**
> "I think the thing we actually have in common is that both companies that are led by researchers who focus on the models, who focus on solving important problems in the world. I think those are the kind of companies that are going to succeed going forward."

**Source:** The Verge - "AI labs wage a reputational knife fight at Davos"

**Finn's angle:** Non-traditional background (property → AI) + deep tool proficiency = exactly what DeepMind/Anthropic value

Added 9 YouTube sources to watch for more quotes.
