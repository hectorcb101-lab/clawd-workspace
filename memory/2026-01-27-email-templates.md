## Conversation Summary

user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +1m 2026-01-27 10:12 UTC] Which email
[message_id: 1533]
assistant: It's sending from **hectorcb101@gmail.com** — that's the Google account I have access to.

That's probably why it's hitting spam — random Gmail address, not associated with you or any known domain.

If you want better deliverability for external contacts, you'd need either:
1. Send from your own email (wfmckie@gmail.com)
2. Set up a proper domain email (e.g., atlas@finnmckie.com)
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +14s 2026-01-27 10:12 UTC] No who did you send to
[message_id: 1535]
assistant: Last one went to **infomdpilot@gmail.com** (the PA version).
user: [Telegram Finn Mckie id:6047368408 +46s 2026-01-27 10:13 UTC] 👍 - save template and to memories
[message_id: 1537]
assistant: Done. Two templates now:

1. **`atlas-email-final.html`** — Personal emails to you
2. **`atlas-email-external.html`** — Professional emails to others (PA, not AI)

Both saved and logged in memory. What's next?
