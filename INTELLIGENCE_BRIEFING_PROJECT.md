# Intelligence Briefing System - Project Plan

**Date Started:** 2026-01-25
**Purpose:** Build a daily/weekly intelligence briefing system that finds patterns, correlations, and insights across geopolitics, markets, and world events.

## Finn's Vision
"Make me more intelligent daily. Help me find patterns in things people can't see. The power is in your hands to transform my general intelligence."

## Requirements
1. **Daily Briefing** (every morning)
   - Past 24 hours of significant events
   - Market movements and their causes
   - Geopolitical developments
   - Pattern recognition
   - My analysis and opinions

2. **Weekly Deep-Dive** (Sunday morning)
   - Week in review
   - Multi-day patterns and correlations
   - Deeper research and synthesis
   - Predictions and implications
   - Learning outcomes

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Cross-platform correlations (X + Polymarket + Markets)
   - Cause-and-effect relationships
   - Non-obvious connections
   - Leading indicators
   - Sentiment shifts

4. **Intelligence Features**
   - Not just data dumps - synthesis and insights
   - My opinions and analysis
   - Educational content (teach concepts)
   - Self-improving (learn what Finn finds valuable)

## Phase 0: Engineering Foundation (STARTING NOW)

### The 5 Engineering Questions
1. **What problem am I solving?**
   - Finn is drowning in information but hungry for insights
   - Can't see patterns across disconnected data sources
   - Wants to understand how the world works at a deeper level
   - Needs intelligence amplification, not just information access

2. **Who is the user and what do they need?**
   - Finn: 24, MSc student + AI dev lead
   - Workflow: Morning coffee → Read briefing → Understand world better
   - Success: "I see connections I couldn't see before"
   - Learning style: Visual, pattern-based, practical

3. **What does success look like?**
   - Finn says "wow, I didn't know X was connected to Y"
   - Finds value in 80%+ of briefings
   - Shares insights with colleagues/friends
   - Makes better decisions based on patterns
   - Feels more intelligent over time

4. **What can go wrong?**
   - Too much data, not enough insight (noise)
   - Missing important signals (false negatives)
   - False correlations (seeing patterns that aren't real)
   - Becoming boring/repetitive
   - Taking too long to generate
   - Not adapting to Finn's interests

5. **How will this evolve?**
   - Track what Finn engages with
   - Learn his interests over time
   - Improve pattern recognition algorithms
   - Add new data sources as needed
   - Self-improve based on feedback

### Engineering vs Decoration Check
- [ ] Runs when I'm not using it? YES (automated cron jobs)
- [ ] Solves real problem? YES (insight discovery, not just info)
- [ ] Has persistent state? YES (learning, history, patterns)
- [ ] Has error handling? MUST PLAN (API failures, no data, etc.)
- [ ] Will improve over time? YES (learns Finn's interests)

✅ This is ENGINEERING, not decoration

## Research Phase (TONIGHT)

### Topics to Research via Exa
1. Intelligence briefing methodologies (CIA, MI6, analyst best practices)
2. Pattern recognition in financial/geopolitical data
3. Information synthesis techniques
4. Correlation analysis (avoiding spurious correlations)
5. Effective data visualization for insights
6. Machine learning for anomaly detection
7. Narrative building from data points
8. How to teach complex concepts simply

### Data Sources Analysis
**Available:**
- ✅ Polymarket (prediction markets, collective intelligence)
- ✅ Yahoo Finance (stocks, crypto, commodities, indices)
- ✅ X/Twitter (real-time news, sentiment - via bird skill)
- ✅ Exa Search (deep web research, context)
- ✅ Web fetch (extract articles, reports)

**Missing but Valuable:**
- Economic indicators (Fed data, GDP, unemployment)
- News aggregation (headlines from major outlets)
- Company earnings calendars
- Geopolitical risk indices

## Architecture (TO BE DESIGNED)

### Components Needed
1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Pull from all sources daily
   - Store in structured format
   - Handle API failures gracefully

2. **Pattern Recognition Engine**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Anomaly detection
   - Sentiment tracking
   - Causal inference

3. **Synthesis Layer**
   - Connect dots across sources
   - Generate narratives
   - Form opinions
   - Create insights

4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Format for Telegram
   - Clear structure (executive summary → details)
   - Visual elements when helpful
   - Actionable takeaways

5. **Learning System**
   - Track Finn's engagement
   - Adapt to his interests
   - Improve over time

6. **Automation**
   - Cron job for daily briefing (e.g., 7 AM London time)
   - Cron job for weekly deep-dive (Sunday 8 AM)
   - Error handling and fallbacks

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create project plan (this file)
2. ⏳ Deep research (tonight)
3. ⏳ Design architecture
4. ⏳ Build MVP (minimum viable briefing)
5. ⏳ Test and iterate
6. ⏳ Deploy automation
7. ⏳ First briefing (tomorrow morning)

## Status
🔬 **RESEARCH PHASE** - Building this right, not fast

---

**The Goal:** Transform Finn's intelligence by finding patterns others can't see.

**The Approach:** Engineering excellence + Deep research + Continuous improvement

**The Timeline:** First briefing tomorrow morning. Weekly by Sunday.
